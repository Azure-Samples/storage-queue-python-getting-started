# Azure Queue Service Sample - The Queue Service provides reliable messaging for workflow processing and for communication 
# between loosely coupled components of cloud services. This sample demonstrates how to perform common tasks including 
# inserting, peeking, getting and deleting queue messages, as well as creating and deleting queues.
